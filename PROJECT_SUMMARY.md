```

### Example 2: Interactive Session
```bash
python -m src.agent

You: My service can't connect to the database
Agent: Let me check the Consul intentions...
[Investigates and provides solution]
```

### Example 3: Production Namespace
```bash
python -m src.agent --namespace production --verbose
```

## Performance Considerations

- **API Calls**: Each tool use makes API calls to K8s/Consul
- **LLM Costs**: GPT-4 calls cost ~$0.03 per 1K tokens
- **Response Time**: Typically 5-15 seconds per query
- **Optimization**: Use gpt-3.5-turbo for faster/cheaper responses

## Security Best Practices

1. **API Keys**: Never commit .env file
2. **RBAC**: Use least-privilege K8s service accounts
3. **Consul ACLs**: Restrict token permissions
4. **Network**: Use secure connections (HTTPS)
5. **Audit**: Log all agent actions

## Troubleshooting the Agent

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'langchain'"**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"Failed to initialize Kubernetes client"**
```bash
kubectl cluster-info  # Verify cluster access
```

**"OpenAI API key error"**
```bash
# Check .env file
cat .env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY
```
